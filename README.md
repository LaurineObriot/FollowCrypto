# FollowCrypto
Personal project completed in 2 weeks.

Application to track crypto-money in real time with MVP Design Pattern for Android and iOS. Written with Dart using Flutter SDK.

After doing a personal project in Swift (for Apple devices), then a personal project for Android with Java and then another one with Kotlin, I wanted to make a project that allows me to make both an application for Apple, and for Android, in one go. And test some new Techno (and Dart!)
